# Expressions

Defines a language for expressions that return a value for a single row of a table. Also gives a React-based UI for editing expressions.

Complex expressions involving joins, arithmetic or case statements can be created visually and then compiled to SQL or interpreted.

See the [docs](docs/Expressions.md) for more information.
